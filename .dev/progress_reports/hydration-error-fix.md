# Hydration Error Fix - Language Toggle

## Problem
The application was experiencing hydration errors due to server/client mismatch in the LanguageToggle component:

```
Warning: Text content did not match. Server: "EN ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§" Client: "PT ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹"
```

## Root Cause
The LanguageContext was trying to read from `localStorage` during initial render:
- Server: Always defaulted to "pt" (no localStorage available)
- Client: Read from localStorage and might get "en" or other stored value
- This created a mismatch during hydration

## Solution Applied
Updated the LanguageContext to follow the proper Remix pattern:

### Before (Problematic Code)
```tsx
const [language, setLanguageState] = useState<"pt" | "en">(() => {
  if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
    return (localStorage.getItem("language") as "pt" | "en") || "pt";
  }
  return "pt";
});
```

### After (Fixed Code)
```tsx
// Always start with the same default state on both server and client
const [language, setLanguageState] = useState<"pt" | "en">("pt");

// Read from localStorage after hydration to prevent server/client mismatch
useEffect(() => {
  const storedLanguage = localStorage.getItem("language") as "pt" | "en";
  if (storedLanguage) {
    setLanguageState(storedLanguage);
  }
}, []);
```

## Key Changes
1. **Consistent Initial State**: Both server and client now start with "pt"
2. **Deferred localStorage Read**: Using `useEffect` to read localStorage after hydration
3. **Added useEffect Import**: Added `useEffect` to the React imports

## Benefits
- âœ… Eliminates hydration errors
- âœ… Maintains user language preferences
- âœ… Follows Remix best practices
- âœ… No flash of incorrect content

## Files Modified
- `app/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx`

## Testing
The hydration errors should now be resolved. The language toggle will:
1. Initially render as "PT ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹" on both server and client
2. Update to the user's stored preference after hydration (if any)
3. Continue to persist language changes to localStorage

This fix follows the standard Remix pattern for handling client-side state that depends on browser APIs.
